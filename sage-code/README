   Computational Aspects of Relaxation Complexity: Possibilities and Limitations
   by Gennadiy Averkov, Christopher Hojny, and Matthias Schymura.


I GENERAL INFORMATION

This directory contains scripts to compute observers of a finite lattice-convex set X
and its relaxation complexity rc(X). To be able to run both scripts, you need a
working installation of Sage, and SCIP 7 together with its Python interface PySCIPOpt.

Information on how to get and install Sage can be found at

	    https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/index.html

SCIP can be dowloaded from

     	    https://www.scipopt.org/,

where you can also find installation instructions. Finally, PySCIPOpt can be found
at

	    https://github.com/scipopt/PySCIPOpt.


II COMPUTING OBSERVERS

The script

     	    observers.sage

provides, beside auxiliary method, the routines

     	    observers_for_parity_complete_case
	    observers_through_direct_procedure

to compute all observers of X. The first method can only be used if X is partity
complete, and runs in this case more efficiently than the second method. Moreover,
to only compute observers in a bounding box of X, the method

	    observers_in_box

can be used. Information on how to call these methods can be found in the documentation
of the script.

III COMPUTING RC

The script

     	    rc.sage

provides the methods

     	    computeRC
     	    computeRCboxapprox

to compute rc(X) if the number of observers is finite. The first method uses a single
mixed-integer programming model to compute rc(X). The second method starts by only
considering observers in a bounding box and iteratively increases the boudning box
until rc(X) has been found. Again, detailed information on how to call the methods
can be found in the documentation of the script.
