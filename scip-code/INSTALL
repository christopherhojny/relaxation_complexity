This file explains how to install the code, which has been used for the paper

   Computational Aspects of Relaxation Complexity
   by Gennadiy Averkov, Christopher Hojny, and Matthias Schymura.

Here is what you have to do to get the code running:

1. Download CDD from https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib and install it. We assume
   that environment variables (pointing to)

   CDD_PATH (lib-src directory of cdd)
   CDD_LIB_PATH (library directory of cdd)

   have been set. When installing cddlib from github, these directories should
   be /path/to/cddlib-master/lib-src and /path/to/cddlib-master/lib-src/.libs,
   respectively.

2. Download SCIP from http://scip.zib.de. We recommend to use at least version 7.0.1,
   because the code has not been tested with older versions.

3. Install SCIP and compile it as described in the INSTALL file of SCIP's main
   directory with your individual settings. Make sure to create the necessary
   softlinks in SCIP's lib directory.

   To replicate the results from the above paper, we recommend to use the compilation
   command "make LPS=spx OPT=opt", i.e.,
   to use the following settings:
     (a) LPS=spx: Use SoPlex as LP solver. For this you have to install the SoPlex,
         which you can also find at http://scip.zib.de. If you have installed SCIP
	 via the SCIP-OptSuite, then you also have installed SoPlex.
     (b) OPT=opt: The code is compiled in optimized mode and runs significantly
         faster.

   On some machines, you should use gmake instead of make.

4. Unpack the enclosed "computeRC-1.0.tgz" or file to a temporary folder (it contains
   the project) or download the project from github. Probably you already did this
   if you read this file.

5. There are two options to determine the path to the SCIP directory:

   - Set the environment variable SCIP_PATH to contain the path to SCIP's root
     directory.

   - Edit the MAKEFILE of the directory computeRC, edit the
     variable SCIPDIR if necessary.  It should point to the directory
     that contains SCIP, i.e., $SCIPDIR/lib contains the SCIP library files.

6. Compile the project: In the main directory computeRC, enter exactly
   the same compilation command as used in Step 2.

7. To run the program, enter
   "bin/computeRC.$(OSTYPE).$(ARCH).$(COMP).$(OPT).$(LPS)"
   (e.g., "bin/computeRC.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.spx2"). The first two arguments
   are mandatory and specify the files containing the set of points X and Y
   for which we want to compute rc(X,Y). It is also possible to provide
   an optional third and fourth parameter, which specify an upper and
   lower bound on rc(X,Y), respectively. Via a fifth optional parameter,
   one can specify a file to which the found relaxation is written.
   If this parameter is not specified, the output is just printed to
   screen. Additional parameters can be:

   -s <setting file>
   -t <time limit>
   -m <mem limit>
   -n <node limit>
   -d <display frequency>
