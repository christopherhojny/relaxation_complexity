I GENERAL INFORMATION

This directory contains scripts to execute computer-aided proofs for Lemma 8 of the article

Computational Aspects of Relaxation Complexity: Possibilities and Limitations
by Gennadiy Averkov, Christopher Hojny, and Matthias Schymura.

To be able to run both scripts, you need a working installation of Sage.

II CALLING THE SCRIPTS

The script

     	    3d-unimodular-sets.sage

computes all lattice polytopes P (up to unimodular equivalence) in the set T3 (specified in
the Lemma) that properly contain the standard simplex and such that the standard simplex is
a simplex of maximum volume in P.

The script

     	    verify_rc_representatives.sage

then verifies that the relaxation complexity of the vertex sets of all these polytopes P as
well as of the standard simplex is 4.
