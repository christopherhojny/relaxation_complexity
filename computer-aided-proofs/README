II CALLING THE SCRIPTS

IIa Lemma 8 from "Computational Aspects of Relaxation Complexity: Possibilities and Limitations"

The script

     	    3d-unimodular-sets.sage

computes all lattice polytopes P (up to unimodular equivalence) in the set T3 (specified in
the Lemma) that properly contain the standard simplex and such that the standard simplex is
a simplex of maximum volume in P.

The script

     	    verify_rc_representatives.sage

then verifies that the relaxation complexity of the vertex sets of all these polytopes P as
well as of the standard simplex is 4.


IIb Proposition1  from "The role of rationality in integer-programming relaxations"

The script

     	    polyhedral_check_Delta_5.sage

computes all mixed-integer points in the relaxation provided in Proposition 1 and
prints these points to the terminal. One can then inspect manually that these points
correspond to the points in the set Delta_5 mentioned in the article.
